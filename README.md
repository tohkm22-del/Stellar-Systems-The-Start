# Stellar Systems, The Start
Stellar Systems-V1.0  
Stellar Systems is a large-scale, creative, semi-realistic interstellar mod for KSP. Similar to KSS2 or Promised Worlds, but made mainly by 1 person😅. So far, there are 4 systems with 3 being complete.

### SYSTEMS:
- Rast - Finished - No analog  
- Nooe - Finished - Upsilon Andromedae analog  
- Swarch - Finished - No analog  
- Xeroon - WIP - No analog  

### LICENSE:
CC-BY-NC-ND

### ISSUES
I'm not sure if Stellar Systems conflicts with mods like KSS2, Promised Worlds, or Kcalbeloh. If it does conflict, please tell me here on [Discord](https://discord.gg/ut3c2edz)  
If there are any other issue report them to me, thank you!

### WHAT IS INCLUDED
There are full science definitions written by Serbhit and me. Full volumetric clouds v5 configs, complete with weather cycles and auroras.

### THE FUTURE
There will be more systems, like a planned Kerbol outer planets, and many exotic worlds to explore.  

**SYSTEMS IDEAS**  
- A B-type star hosting many unique planets.  
- A system early in its development, with many large protoplanetary disks and chaotic environments.  
- A orange giant star, nearing the end of its life.  

**WIP SYSTEMS**  
- Xeroon

### INSTALLATION
Download and unzip the Stellar Systems, and put the Stellar Systems into your GameData.
