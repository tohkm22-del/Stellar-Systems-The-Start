# Stellar Systems, The Start
Stellar Systems-V1.0.3
Stellar Systems is a large-scale, creative, semi-realistic interstellar mod for KSP. Similar to KSS2 or Promised Worlds, but made mainly by 1 person😅. So far, there are 5 systems with 4 being complete.

### ISSUES
I'm not sure if Stellar Systems conflicts with mods like KSS2, Promised Worlds, or Kcalbeloh. If it does conflict, please tell me here on [Discord](https://discord.gg/7gJw6GxX)  
If there are any other issue report them to me, thank you!

### WHAT IS INCLUDED
There are full science definitions written by Serbhit and me. Full volumetric clouds v5 configs, complete with weather cycles and auroras.  
4 finished systems and 1 WIP.

### THE FUTURE
There will be more systems, like a planned Kerbol outer planets, and many exotic worlds to explore.  
Parallax Continued support will be done in the future, as I average 1-2 fps with my current setup, so it's not feasible right now.

**SYSTEMS IDEAS**  
- A B-type star hosting many unique planets.  
- A system early in its development, with many large protoplanetary disks and q chaotic environment.  
- A orange giant star, nearing the end of its life.  

**WIP SYSTEMS**  
- Keppe
